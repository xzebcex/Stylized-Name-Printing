# Stylized-Name-Printing
This code prompts the user to enter their name, then prints the string "###Hello###" followed by each letter of the entered name surrounded by asterisks (e.g. "a" for the letter "a" in the name "Adam"). The result is a unique and stylized display of the user's name.

## Description
This code, titled "Stylized Name Printing", prompts the user to enter their name by using the input() function. The entered name is then stored in the variable name. The code then prints the string "###Hello###" to the console using the print() function.

After that, it starts an iteration through each letter of the entered name by using a for loop. The for loop iterates over the string name, and assigns each letter to a variable i on each iteration. The code then uses the print() function to print i with the surrounding asterisks, which makes each letter of the name surrounded by asterisks.

## Usage
To use the code, simply run it and enter your name when prompted. The output will be the string "###Hello###" followed by each letter of your name surrounded by asterisks.

## Example
Input: "Happy"
Output:
